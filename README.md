🛡️ Cybersecurity Foundations – Career Reflection
Welcome to my cybersecurity portfolio. This project is part of my journey through the Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate program. It showcases my reflections, learnings, and progress as I pursue a career in cybersecurity.

🎯 Why I’m Pursuing Cybersecurity
I’m driven by a strong desire to protect people and digital assets from cyber threats. There’s a deep sense of purpose in working to secure systems and help individuals and organizations stay safe in an increasingly digital world. Cybersecurity allows me to blend technology with meaningful impact.

🧑‍💻 My Career Goals
My starting point is to become a Security Operations Center (SOC) Analyst, where I’ll monitor, detect, and respond to cyber incidents. Over time, I aim to grow through continuous learning, certifications, and hands-on experience — ultimately becoming a top-level cybersecurity expert making strategic contributions to the field.

🧠 Key Concepts I’ve Learned So Far
Through the certificate program, I’ve developed a strong foundation in cybersecurity principles, including:

🔐 CIA Triad – Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability

⚠️ Risk, Threats & Vulnerabilities – Understanding and identifying digital risks

🧰 Security Frameworks – Including NIST, ISO 27001

🛡️ Security Controls – Preventive, Detective, and Corrective controls

📚 CISSP 8 Security Domains – A high-level overview of areas like asset security, network architecture, and risk management

🔍 Why Cybersecurity Matters
We live in a connected world — and that makes security essential. Cybersecurity plays a vital role in protecting data, systems, and people from harm. I’m excited to contribute to building safer technologies and more resilient digital environments.

🚀 What’s Next
Next, I’ll be working on:

✅ Risk Assessment Report – Identifying potential risks and their impact

🧠 Threat Modeling Diagram – Visualizing and mitigating threats

These artifacts will be part of this portfolio to demonstrate my growing practical skills.

🔐 This portfolio is a living document — as I learn, I’ll keep updating it with new insights, projects, and reflections. Thank you for visiting!
